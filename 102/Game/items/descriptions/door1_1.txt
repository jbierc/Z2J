Passing through the door, you discover another room.
In the center, there are three smaller pedestals.
As you walk closer, you see that on each of them,
there is a big cubical button glinting faintly in the dim light.
The buttons seem identical at first glance, yet each one radiates a unique aura.
Which one do you want to press?
LEFT, CENTRE or RIGHT?
