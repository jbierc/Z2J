As the key turns, the brick wall slowly slides open,
revealing a hidden chamber bathed in a soft golden light.
In the center, atop a stone pedestal, rests a gleaming chest.
The room is silent, the air thick with the weight of ancient secrets
youâ€™ve found the treasure at last. Congratulations! This is the END!
