You find yourself in a dark, creepy room.
Shadows dance across the walls, and it's mysteriously quiet.
In the middle of the room you see a PEDESTAL, SOMETHING is laying next to it.
On the opposite wall, you can barely see a DOOR with no handle.
The room feels heavy with secrets, and you have a sense that there's more to discover here...
